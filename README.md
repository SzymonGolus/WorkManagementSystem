Work Management System for Surveying Company

Ten years ago I wrote a script for surveying company I work in, to help us organize our work and stop forgetting about things to do.
It was in PHP/HTML language with mySQL database.

Now i'm going to write some new version in Flask and Python. I think Bootstrap will help the app to look nicer than old version.

What the app should have:
- adding, editing informations about clients
- adding, editing informations about orders, orders' status, work progress
- additional tasks in orders
- more will come...
